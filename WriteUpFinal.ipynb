    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The techniques chose for preprossessing were Gray Scaling, Image Normalization, and boosting the number of images to process with affine image randomization. Additionally, the dataset was shuffled before fed into our trainer. Color Gradient processing similar to the lane lines project is planned for the future, though it will need to be tested further before implementing into a solution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Gray scaling was performed in order to Grayscaling does reduce the total number of variables to consider. Intueitively, color seems useful as another possible neuron exciter, however, there is some evidence to suggested that networks perform better after grayscaling [Sermanet and LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf). A side by side test of with and without grayscaling on an identitical network architecture will be performed in the future, however due to time constraints it has not been tested yet.\n",

    "Image Normalizations was used in order to standardize the effect of our learning rate on our neurons weights. Without normalization, bright images and dull images would have vastly different pixel value ranges, which would cause issue when training scalar weight values to classify them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Affine Image Bolstering was done in order to expand and normalize the data set, as well as to add images with different translations, rotations, and color contrasts to the data set. The Affine'ing function used was from [vxy10 - ImageAugmentation - Github](https://github.com/vxy10/ImageAugmentation). The training set was increased to ~5x it's orriginal size, with higher priority given to sign images with lower numbers of training images. The Pre and Post Augmentation images in show the sign class distribution before and after dataset augmentation.\n",

It was also chosen due to it's higher performance over [AdadeltaOptimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5701) and [ProximalGradientDescentOptimizer](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3793-efficient-learning-using-forward-backward-splitting.pdf) when run in test trials. The adamoptimizer proved to indeed be resiliant to changes in hyper paramters, though many attempts to change the learning rate value away from the document suggested value of .001 cuased a drop in performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our batch size was left at 128, as a higher number of batch size seemed to correlate negatively with our accuracy. This is possibly due to the frequency of weight variables being updated, with a higher frequency with a lower batch size, thus causing more granular neural adaption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ten epochs were imployed. It appears a slight increase may be gainined by further epochs, however, long training times discouraged attempts beyond 10. Hyper parameters were changed frequently, however after many attempts they were returned to the values utilized in the LeNet lab.\n",

    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",

    "The LeNet architecture was chosen for this problem due to the success and quick training times aprrently achieved in the UDACity project video. Knowing that a quick and high accuracy solution could be achieved with this architecture, it formed the starting point for most expirements. Additionally, the LeNet implemnetation is very similar in architecture to that proposed by [Sermanet and LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/sermanet-ijcnn-11.pdf) where an accuracy of 98.81% was achieved.\n",

As such the LeNet network model seems a suitable place to start for further investigation. Most of the large improvements in accuracy that were observable were derived from changes in the training set, and not in changes from the architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    " * 1 : The first image is came out suprisingly well after post processing, though it does contain many similarities with other signs such as a circular boarder, an inside and outside color shade patern, and many diagonal lines inside the inner circle of the sign.\n",
    " * 2 : The second image is one of the more unique images, as it has a triangular border and a vertical solid line in the center.\n",
    " * 3 : The third image shares a rectagonal shape with many other signs, and has a series of diagonal lines in its middle which may trigger false activations.\n",
    " * 4 : The fourth image might be difficult to classify due to the shape of the 6 in the image. The 6 has a diagonal line on top and a circle on the bottom. These edges are shared by many many other signs, and could trigger a false activation of neurons during classification.\n",
    " * 5 : The final image might be difficult to classify due to the lack of definitive boarder around the edges once the image that occured during processing. Due to the interpolation of the image to reduce size, the clear octogonal edge pattern of the sign has bled into a somewhat circular pattern. additionally, the grayscaling of the image would further reduce distinguishing patters of White Lettering on Red Sign.\n",

    "The model performed very well for the first 3 images, the 70km, general caution, and priority road, however, The classifier failed to correctly identify the stop sign, or the 60 km sign. Clearly this is due to the machine algorithm having little respect for local traffic enforcement and wanting to travel only at speeds 70+ km and stopping for nothing in it's tracks. A more likely cause would be due to the small amount of variability between some styles of signs at low resolutions, and weights not being able to differentiate well enough. The accuracy of our new images was much lower than the accuracy of our training set. I was very surprised that the stopsign was misclassified, however after looking at the post-modified image the outline boarder of the sign was very blurred it could appear similar to the a circular sign. This is a situation where color likely would have added to the accuracy of classifying the image rather than detracted.\n",
